From the scenic heights of Himachal Pradesh to the vibrant cityscapes of Hyderabad, my journey has been nothing short of an adventure. My academic story began at Bharati Vidyapeet School in Himachal, where I laid the foundation of my education alongside my elder brother. The next chapter unfolded in Hyderabad at St. Mark's High School, where I thrived and set my sights on the future.

With a passion for technology, I earned a place at Vellore Institute of Technology, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My time there was marked by exciting projects, a dynamic role in the ACM club's technical team, and a thrilling internship as a GIS developer at a startup. Each experience has been a step towards my dream, and I can't wait to see where this path leads next.
