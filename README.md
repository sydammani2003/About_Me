My journey in the world of technology began at a very young age. At just one year old, I moved with my family to the serene landscapes of Himachal Pradesh, where I completed my primary education at Bharati Vidyapeet School. Growing up with a biological elder brother, I soon transitioned to the bustling city of Hyderabad, where I graduated from St. Mark's High School.

My passion for computer science led me to secure a seat at the prestigious Vellore Institute of Technology. During my bachelor's program, I immersed myself in a multitude of projects, honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of innovation. My dedication earned me a spot as a technical team member in the ACM club, where I collaborated with brilliant minds to solve complex problems.

Eager to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, I seized the opportunity to work as a GIS developer intern at a startup. This experience, coupled with my freelancing role as a Subject Matter Expert, allowed me to refine my expertise and broaden my horizons. Additionally, I ventured into the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, gaining valuable insights as a crypto broker.

As I continue to explore the endless possibilities in technology, I am excited to share my journey and contributions with the world through my GitHub profile. Welcome to my digital portfolio, where passion meets innovation!
